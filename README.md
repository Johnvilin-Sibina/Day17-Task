This repository is for day 17 task Restcountries & Weather using fetch API.
This repository contains three files.
The file index.html contains the code and link to run the task in the browser.
The file script.js contains the JavaScript code. In this file I have created all the html elements required dynamically.
The file style.css is the stylesheet.
I have used bootstrap cards to display the required data.
